            <p>My interest in mechanical engineering started around the time I learned to walk. When I wasn't at school or in the pool practicing, you could find me in my dad's machine 
                shop building, fixing, and tinkering anything I could get my hands on. Flash forward about 20 years, I continue to do what I love every day as a senior mechanical 
                engineering student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with minors in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Computational Science, further challenging me and guiding me 
                towards a technology driven future.</p>
            <p>Throughout my college years, I have enhanced my design and technical skills immensely, specifically working on projects such as a fully 
                functioning 2D Core XY plotter, a fully optimized panel airplane wing design, and a series of safety lifting fixtures for die additions.</p>
            <p>From 3 rotations at General Motors working as a Tool and Die Group Leader Intern, Mechanical Engineering Intern, and Facilities Engineering Intern, I have a gained a proficiency in manufacturing processes, 
                root cause analysis, and computer aided engineering skills. I hope to continue to implement these skills to make a lasting impact in the world of engineering. Frequently 
                described as efficient, ambitious, and communicative by my peers, I can be relied upon to help your company achieve its goals.</p>
