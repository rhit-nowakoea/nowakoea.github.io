                    <h2>Helicopter Link</h2>
                    <img src = "graphics/helicopter_link.png">
                    <p>Freshman year, my team, which included two other members, designed and optimized a link connected to a helicopter blade rotating at 1300 rpm. Given three 
                        options for thickness, a provided plastic material, and seventy-eight different possible placements, the goal was to create the lightest link that could 
                        withstand a force of this magnitude among a class of fifteen other teams.  Using my knowledge of statics and mechanics of materials, I personally calculated 
                        the force acting on the link given each placement using Excel. After finding the minimum force, I calculated the volume of each link using SolidWorks with the 
                        three thicknesses and the agreed upon factor of safety. As seen above, the final link implements a simple design, weighing in at less than two grams. Upon 
                        completion, not only did our link withstand the force of the blade, but it was the lightest of all teams. Much like work done in industry, the problem solving 
                        techniques I implemented during this project resulted in successful completion of the project with accurate and precise optimization. The final link demonstrates 
                        my knowledge of statics, SolidWorks and Excel, and my ability to solve complex problems in an organized and precise fashion, skills required to succeed in the 
                        field of Mechanical Engineering.</p>

                    <h2>CAD Modeling</h2>
                    <img src = "graphics/cad_modeling.png">
                    <p>Throughout my college years I have created many designs in various CAD platforms including SolidWorks, Shapr, and multiple dental programs. Many of my 
                        SolidWorks projects were completed my freshman year in a graphical communications class, but most were out of interest. As seen to the right, I have created a 
                        sink and a trombone which illustrate my competency with 3D drawing, lofting, and revolving as well as more basic methods of extruding, shelling, and filleting. 
                        These skills are also displayed in my other SolidWorks projects portfolio where designs of vehicles, intricate artworks, and tools are 
                        present. Specifically, a project titled "If Tablet" illustrates my ability to use less common features of SolidWorks. As for dental CAD, I worked for an oral 
                        maxillofacial surgeon for approximately five years where I was tasked with creating, converting, and cleaning CT scans using software similar to Dentrix.  My 
                        work on these cases aided in the success of over 500 surgeries throughout my time in the office. Due to HIPAA, I cannot showcase these works, but the image above 
                        provides similar characteristics such as the highly detailed denture creations with crowns, caps, and bite indention. My use of multiple CAD 
                        platforms details my competency in 3D modeling as well as my ability to adapt to changes, vital skills for Mechanical Engineers.</p>

                    <h2>Nurse Movement Simulation</h2>
                    <img src = "graphics/nurse_movement.png">
                    <p>Freshman year of college, I took a computer programming class focused on MATLAB as the main language. Throughout the quarter, we completed three main projects. 
                        The first project specifically tested my ability to communicate with a partner through the use of coded comments. Myself and a partner were tasked with using 
                        pre-allocated data to simulate the movement of nurses when lifting and transporting patients. Without an ability to meet frequently, my partner and I were 
                        forced to rely on comments as seen above to communicate the purpose and thought behind our individual code. Even though neither of us were present for 
                        every coding session, we were able to review the other's comments and fully understand the importance behind each block of code. Because of our clear and 
                        concise commenting technique, we were able to finish the project well before the deadline and receive a perfect score. More than just proper coding technique, 
                        implementing comments into code allows for greater explanation in a less technical manner so that everyone can understand even the most complex material. 
                        Without implementing this skill, long and complicated code becomes confusing and incomprehensible and it becomes difficult to communicate and work efficiently 
                        with partners.</p>

                    <h2>Egg Cracker Technical Report</h2>
                    <img src = "graphics/egg_cracker.png">
                    <p>Technical writing is a skill that many engineers lack but need in the workplace. My freshman year of college, I worked with a partner to enhance this skill by 
                        creating a technical report of an egg cracker in our design class. Given the product, we had to reverse engineer an egg cracker by determining materials used 
                        in production, creating the design specs, and examining many other features. Once we gathered all necessary information, I was tasked with outlining the product, 
                        providing stakeholder perspectives, and describing the geometry and performance of the product. The overview of the report as seen to the right provides a short 
                        description of the egg cracker along with an image and small table depicting the important consumer features of the product. I designed the section in this manner 
                        to allow for easy comprehension among all readers while still providing a brief technical description. I provided both basic sketches along with engineering 
                        drawings to showcase the importance of each part to everyone rather than fully 
                        relying on calculations and knowledge of engineering drawings. Then, when portraying the stakeholder perspectives, I provided a professional cannon table along 
                        with a visual representation of a house of quality, both outlined in a brief description using an easily understandable format. While maintaining a technical 
                        tone, I made the document legible for those outside of the field of engineering. This technical report outlines my ability to accurately depict a product in an 
                        efficient manner as required when developing projects in the field.</p>

                    <h2>Bubble Bobble</h2>
                    <img src = "graphics/bubble_bobble.jpg">
                    <p>During my second year of college, a partner and I used Java to recreate the video game, "Bubble Bobble". Using high cohesion and low coupling, two of the most 
                        important coding techniques, we created an efficient and highly functional design. Most notably, I was tasked with implementing inheritance among the classes as 
                        well as graphics, sprite behaviors, and key listeners. As you can see in the image above, the graphics highly resemble the original game and all of the 
                        sprites have intelligent behaviors. Also, the UML diagram showcases the code efficiency and inheritance that I implemented. My work on this project 
                        demonstrates my competency in the field of Computer Science, a skill many Mechanical Engineers lack. As a Mechanical Engineer, I believe that an understanding of 
                        code is essential to the work place, not only allowing for high speed calculations and assembly line optimization, but also for growth and efficiency in the work 
                        place.</p>
